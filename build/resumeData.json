    "bio":"I'm constantly in search of new information.  Data communication and networking is infinitely interesting, I think I missed my calling in electrical/computer engineering.  As such studying software defined radios, encryption systems, jamming, cancelling, and signal measures.  Before these I developed my passion for software development and computational mathematics.  Outside of technology my next interests are learning languages and being outside.  I spend a lot of time in the woods- backing, hiking, running, rucking, and wildlife watching.  Languages and communications in unfamiliar cultures are very interesting.  In my past I've studied Arabic, Hindi, Russian and Urdu; to this day I still study French.  Hopefully in the future I'll be able to practice these with local speakers.",

We decided to do an Android app using an open API because none of us had used these technologies before. It took us eight weeks, but we managed to have most of the endpoints covered, and a nice looking user interface. Personally I build the functionality out for getting train routes and details. Learning about XML and Document Builder Factory were my biggest points of satisfaction. Other than that it was another cup of Java. ",

Problem: We needed to gather demographic data on the Forbes top 2000. We didn't have access to any Forbes API, just a list of websites.  Solution: Having recently completed a Python project using the Google Maps API a web scraper was created, with data processing after.  It was hammered out in a night, hence not being super clean.",
